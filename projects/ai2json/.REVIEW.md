# Overview:
ai2json is a unified abstraction layer for invoking CLI-based AI providers (Claude, Codex) to generate structured JSON output. The project defines a clean abstract interface (AI2JSON) and concrete implementations that handle subprocess orchestration, dynamic timeout calculation, JSON extraction with fence-marker parsing, and robust error handling. The architecture demonstrates strong separation of concerns with base implementation in TheAI2JSON, provider-specific adapters (Claude2JSON, Codex2JSON), and a factory pattern for instantiation. The codebase is feature-complete and production-ready with no functional regressions reported.

# Review:
Code quality is high across all modules with solid engineering practices: proper abstraction, defensive error handling, and clear separation between interface definition, base implementation, and provider-specific adapters. The project is effectively 100% complete functionally. The TheAI2JSON base class provides robust JSON extraction with multiple fallback mechanisms including fence marker parsing and heuristic repair via _fix_json. Timeout calculation using bit-shift approximation (>> 10 for KB) is pragmatic with acceptable ~2.4% error. Provider adapters implement consistent discovery fallbacks (node script, bundled CLI, command) ensuring cross-platform resilience. Testability is strong due to modular design and deterministic entry probing, though explicit automated test coverage is not documented. Primary risks center on maintainability and operational clarity: project-wide absence of module/class docstrings contradicts best practices and slows onboarding; dangerous permission flags (--dangerously-skip-permissions, --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox) require operational guardrails; executable discovery only checks path existence without validating executability, leading to late failures with opaque subprocess errors. Secondary polish items include aging Claude permission comments that may drift from CLI semantics, Codex prompt concatenation that risks semantic ambiguity, shared _dump string interpolation typo, and edge cases in _strip_fence and _extract_json that may fail with multiple or nested JSON blocks. Critical priorities: add comprehensive docstrings to all modules and classes, tighten executable validation and failure messaging, document adapter contracts explicitly, and consider decoupling prompt handling semantics.

# Notes:
- Bit-shift timeout approximation (>> 10) introduces ~2.4% error, acceptable for timeout estimation purposes
- _fix_json method uses heuristic repair for AI-generated JSON escaping issues; best-effort approach that may not handle all malformed cases
- Factory method uses delayed imports to avoid circular dependencies between index.py and ai2json.py
- Adapters mirror shared fallback launch strategy (node script → bundled CLI → command) for cross-platform resilience
- Permission flag asymmetry (uid 0 vs non-root) is deliberate design for Claude CLI stability
- Claude and Codex streams delegate final JSON scrubbing to hardened base extractor

# Issues:
- Project-wide absence of module and class docstrings across adapters contradicts best practices and significantly hurts maintainability (ai2json/_ai2json/claude.py, codex.py)
- Executable discovery only checks path existence via os.path.exists(), not executability; corrupted or non-executable binaries fail late with opaque subprocess errors (ai2json/_ai2json/claude.py, codex.py)
- _fix_json debug output prints to stdout instead of using _dump, inconsistent with other debug routing (ai2json/ai2json.py:_fix_json)

# Imperfections:
- _strip_fence uses find/rfind which may fail if multiple fenced blocks exist; should consider using first complete block instead of first prefix + last suffix (ai2json/ai2json.py:_strip_fence)
- _extract_json assumes single JSON object by finding first { and last }; nested or multiple objects in payload could cause incorrect extraction (ai2json/ai2json.py:_extract_json)
- Factory method create raises ValueError for unsupported AI types but does not include list of valid options in error message (ai2json/ai2json.py:create)
- No validation that timeout remains positive after calculation; extremely short prompts with custom per-KB budget could produce negative or zero timeout (ai2json/ai2json.py:init)
- ai() abstract method lacks documentation on whether it should return constant or computed value (ai2json/index.py:ai)
- exec method typed as 'Any' but comment specifies 'expected to be dict'; consider stronger typing as 'dict[str, Any] | None' (ai2json/index.py:exec)
- create factory comment mentions 'etc.' for supported providers but implementation only supports 'codex' and 'claude' (ai2json/index.py:create)
- Claude adapter's verbose permission comments may drift from actual CLI semantics over time (ai2json/_ai2json/claude.py)
- Shared _dump() string interpolation typo persists across adapters (ai2json/_ai2json/claude.py, codex.py)
- Codex adapter concatenates system/user prompts in single newline string, risking semantic ambiguity (ai2json/_ai2json/codex.py)
- hasattr(os,'getuid') root detection can misbehave on WSL/Cygwin but remains low risk currently (ai2json/_ai2json/claude.py)
